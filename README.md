# Mpi_Jm

Mpi_Jm (MPI Job Manager) is a system for efficiently bundling related tasks for supercomputing.  

*Objectives*  
* Efficiently run a large set of jobs of bounded size in a large allocation of nodes.  
* Solve node fragmentation function.   Repeated launch and completion of jobs leaves available nodes spread out with poor interconnect performance.
* Automate binding of node resources, picking the right cores to match GPU use, setting affinity for openMP threads.
* Support overlay of jobs using distinct resources on the same nodes, i.e. GPU vs CPU jobs.  
* Jobs support pre and post actions that can be used to chain computations with simple dependencies.  
* Customizable collection of workload with python based frontend.
* Dynamic dependencies - jobs can wait for set of prerequisite conditions like completion of a job with neighboring parameters.
* Python based runtime estimation.   Can implement machine learning model configured on prior run data.
* Dynamic reconfiguration of jobs to compute inside allocation time.
